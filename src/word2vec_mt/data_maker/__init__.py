'''
Data making helper package.

Used to assist with manually constructing a similar word data set consisting of
a sample of words called source words together with and their similar words
taken from one of the vocabularies.
Each source word - similar words pair is called an entry.

An entry is validated by checking that:

* The source word is in the source vocabulary.
* The similar words are in the similars vocabulary.
* There is at least one similar word.
* The source word and its similars are all unique.
* The source word is different from the words in previous entries.

There is also a random data splitter included for splitting the produced data set into a train,
validation, development, and test split.
The validation split is for early stopping and the development split is for hyperparameter tuning.
